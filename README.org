#+TITLE: Advent of Code

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd 2019/
stack install

stack exec aoc2019-exe 01    # execute the given day.
# or
stack exec aoc2019-exe last  # execute the most recent day with a source file.
#+END_SRC

* Notes

In the greatest of hackathon traditions, these solutions follow the Easiest
Thing That Worksâ„¢ methodology.


* Creating a new Day source file

** Download input file into =data/inputs/=

This file should have a two digit filename, with no extension. The input file
must exist, even if then problem doesn't supply one.

** Create a new =Day01.hs= file in =src/=
** Update =days= export in =src/Days.hs=

I would prefer if this were automated, but that will be a TODO for now.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
module Day01 (parts) where

parts :: [((String -> IO String), Maybe String)]
parts = [ (part1, Nothing)
        , (part2, Nothing)
        ]

part1 input = return ""
part2 input = return ""
#+END_SRC
