* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
stack install

stack exec aoc 2019 01    # Execute the given day.
stack exec aoc 2019 last  # Execute the most recent day with a source file.
stack exec aoc 2019 all   # Execute every day with a source file.
#+END_SRC

* Notes

In the greatest of hackathon traditions, these solutions follow the Easiest
Thing That Works™ methodology.


* Creating a new Day source file

** Download input file into =data/inputs/=

This file should have a two digit filename, with no extension. The input file
must exist, even if then problem doesn't supply one.

** Create a new =Day01.hs= file in =src/=
** Update =days= export in =src/Days.hs=

I would prefer if this were automated, but that will be a TODO for now.
